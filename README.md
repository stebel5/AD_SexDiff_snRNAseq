# AD_SexDiff_snRNAseq

Code for analyses and figures within R for Belonwu and Li et al. paper entitled "Leveraging single-cell RNA-seq to characterize sex-specific and cell type-specific transcriptional response in Alzheimer’s disease."

Single nuclei RNA-Seq data and metadata were accessed from their respective repositories: the prefrontal cortex from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Alzheimer’s Disease Project (AMP-AD) Knowledge Portal under the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18485175; https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3157322), and the entorhinal cortex from a data repository provided by Grubman et al. (http://adsn.ddnetbio.com/). Data from the entorhinal cortex are also available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession number GSE138852.

Mathys code files are written for the prefrontal cortex snRNA-seq dataset made available from the Mathys et al. Nature 2019 paper. Grubman code files are written for the entorhinal cortex snRNA-seq dataset made available from the Grubman et al. Nature Neuroscience 2019 paper.
